# Quick Slot Machine in PixieJS
To launch the game either visit [My Website](https://wrexial.github.io/alias-games.com/games/Slots/index.html) or host index.html, /js and /assets in the same folder.

Overall I think it went well being the first time i've touched js in years, there were some things I wasn't sure how to best approach them, so I took a more simple solution of tracking ids. There might be better systems which I'm currently unaware of like the c# enum system, having a state machine rather than a simple bool check, etc. It's mostly documented inline where I wasn't too confident of wtf I was doing.
